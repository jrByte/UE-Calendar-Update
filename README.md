# UE-Calendar-Update
This is an automated web scraping script. This will automatically log into University of Applied Sciences and download all the classes for that month. This program will then write this data into a CV file that can be exported to the desired calendar.
# Future Plans:
From trial and error this is temporarily the best solution. Future changes can be made by using google calendar api. Currently the libraries aren't working with my python version.
